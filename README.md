# Chair-Mounted Mini-Tables

Small tables that can attach to your chair for mounting split keyboards.
As seen in the [Trackswitch Manuform](https://github.com/rish987/trackswitch-manuform) hyper-ergonomic keyboard.

Why should you mount your keyboard to your chair?
- Allows for a much more natural shoulder angle while typing (i.e. your upper arms are straight down rather than extending outwards to reach a keyboard on a table)
- If you have an articulated chair, the keyboards are kept at the same position relative to your body while you are leaning back, swivelling, or adjusting the height.
- Free up your desk for other things!!!
